# Food-Truck-Finder

This App allows users to find Food Trucks in the San Francisco Area, It provides information about food trucks location and their current

address, recipes and vendor registration(Book events). The App uses Node JS/React Router Dom, Redux, and Axios for the server and routing,

MongoDB/Mongoose for the database coming from our local and Remote DB. For the layout of our site we used pure React to implement master 

components that make it easy and simple to navigate in the most convenient way.
